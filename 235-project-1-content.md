## High Concept
You play as an undead, who has just awoken in your crypt. You must sneak and perhaps kill your way through the crypt, gradually picking up powers as you go. The only problem, when you die, you wait a year to come back so the crypt is refilled with enemies but you stay in the same place.

These items will have powerful effects, such as area damage and healing. The player may choose to avoid enemies in order to gather items instead. Combat will be simple and involve
