# Cypt Breaker Game Proposal                                                                               
## High Concept
You play as an undead, who has just awoken in your crypt. You must sneak and perhaps kill your way through the crypt, gradually picking up powers as you go. The only problem, when you die, you wait a year to come back so the crypt is refilled with enemies but you stay in the same place.
## Genre
This game will be an Action Adventure game. Its gameplay genre will be rogue-like using ascii style graphics, turn based movement and combat and random generation of enemy locations. It differentiates from games like rogue by using the same floor layout after every death, but the enemy positions and types will be pseudo random.
## Platform
The game will be Desktop only. In order to support the more advanced controls needed for a traditional rogue like experience a keyboard and mouse will be needed to play the game. As such the game will be designed with desktop in mind.
## Story
The game's story will simply be about the player trying to break out of the crypt. The mood will be tense and creepy. Using black and white ascii graphics accompanied by 8-bit, lofi, ambient horror sound effects to create most of the mood. enemies will likely come with an effect like a violin sting.
The player's motivation will be to clear floors. As the player clears out enemies the floor will open up and the player will be able to explore more of the crypt.
## Esthetics
As discussed before the game will use ascii art and an 8-bit sound score. The sound will most likely be semi-procedural mostly used to generate atmosphere.
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The primary actions the player will be taking are movement, combat, and avoidance. The player will be moving through the crypt in order to discover items. These items will have powerful effects, such as area damage and healing. The player may choose to avoid enemies in order to gather items instead. Combat will be simple and involve 
### Control
The game will control using the Keyboard. Specifically, wasd will be used to move, spacebar to attack, and the number keys to use items. If an item requires a target, the cursor will be moved using wasd and selected using the spacebar.
### Onboarding
There will be a tutorial level in wich the player will have a chance to use all objects, get used to controlling the game and begin to develop knowledge of the actions they can take during the game. The level will be much more linear than other levels and will have tutorial messages telling the user how to play the game.
### Player learning
Players will be able to learn abilities like how to use items and terrain to there advantage. they will also become increasingly familiar with level designs as the levels themselves will stay the same accross runs.
